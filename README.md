# Calculator: Revamped
We wanted to recreate the calculator we made together before because since creating it our web development skills have been improving, and this was a way to demonstrate our progress so far. Previously [@JakePazz](https://github.com/JakePazz/) did the javascript and [@Nydonidd](https://github.com/Nydonidd) did the CSS styling. We switched around for this project, to work on our weaker areas. Not much to it. Just a calculator with a couple themes to choose from.
